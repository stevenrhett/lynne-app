                            With over 15 years of experience in the criminal justice system and prison
                            education, Lynne Sullivan is a passionate advocate for providing
                            high-quality education to system-impacted individuals. She graduated with
                            honors from the Boston University Prison Education Program in 2009, earning
                            a bachelor's degree in sociology, and went on to become the Regional Manager
                            for the Petey Greene Program in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In this
                            role, she oversees academic support for incarcerated individuals in several
                            correctional facilities, community correctional centers, youth centers, and
                            reentry programs.

                            Lynne's dedication to improving the lives of system-impacted people extends
                            beyond her professional work. She serves as the PGP liaison to the Tufts
                            Prison Initiative at Tisch College and co-created the Tufts Educational
                            Reentry Network (MyTERN), where she mentors formerly incarcerated students
                            and provides academic support. Additionally, Lynne is a member of the
                            Advisory Boards for MyTERN and the Rescue Mission of Trenton and frequently
                            speaks on behalf of Partakers Inc., a nonprofit that supports prison
                            education programs in Massachusetts. As an activist, she has contributed her
                            perspective and voice to several published articles and books, with a focus
                            on reducing recidivism, promoting reentry and education, and strengthening
                            communities.

                            Lynne's personal journey as a first-generation college graduate fuels her
                            belief that education is the key to ending mass incarceration. In her words,
                            "Education gives a person options, the option to choose different paths in
                            life, the option to be who they never thought they could be." In 2021, Lynne
                            earned a master's degree in criminal justice from Boston University, further
                            solidifying her expertise in the field.
