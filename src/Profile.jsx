                    With over 15 years of experience in the criminal justice system and prison
                    education, Lynne Sullivan is a passionate advocate for providing
                    high-quality education to system-impacted individuals. She graduated with
                    honors from the Boston University Prison Education Program in 2009, earning
                    a bachelor's degree in sociology, and went on to become the Regional Manager
                    for the Petey Greene Program in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In this
                    role, she oversees academic support for incarcerated individuals in several
                    correctional facilities, community correctional centers, youth centers, and
                    reentry programs.

                    Lynne's dedication to improving the lives of system-impacted people extends
                    beyond her professional work. She serves as the PGP liaison to the Tufts
                    Prison Initiative at Tisch College and co-created the Tufts Educational
                    Reentry Network (MyTERN), where she mentors formerly incarcerated students
                    and provides academic support. Additionally, Lynne is a member of the
                    Advisory Boards for MyTERN and the Rescue Mission of Trenton and frequently
                    speaks on behalf of Partakers Inc., a nonprofit that supports prison
                    education programs in Massachusetts. As an activist, she has contributed her
                    perspective and voice to several published articles and books, with a focus
                    on reducing recidivism, promoting reentry and education, and strengthening
                    communities.

                    Lynne's personal journey as a first-generation college graduate fuels her
                    belief that education is the key to ending mass incarceration. In her words,
                    "Education gives a person options, the option to choose different paths in
                    life, the option to be who they never thought they could be." In 2021, Lynne
                    earned a master's degree in criminal justice from Boston University, further
                    solidifying her expertise in the field.
